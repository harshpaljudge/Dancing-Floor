# Dancing-Floor
Introduction:
This is a website which is an example of how we can add multiple animation character on a single floor and also add dancing animation in synchronisation manner.
Where two couple are dancing in salsa and samba form.

Detailed workflow:
1.Created the model from Mixamo.
2.Then I pick the animation of "Dance" for instance.
3.Download animated models as .FBX files.
4.Use Blender to combine the animated models into one.
5.Export as .GLB (animation as Animation Group).
6.Import the .GLB file into babylon.js file.
7.We're going to repeat these steps and add the rest of the characters.
