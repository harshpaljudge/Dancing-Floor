# Dancing-Floor
Introduction:<br>
This is a website which is an example of how we can add multiple animation character on a single floor and also add dancing animation in synchronisation manner.
Where two couple are dancing in salsa and samba form.

Detailed workflow:<br>
1.Created the model from Mixamo.<br>
2.Then I pick the animation of "Dance" for instance.<br>
3.Download animated models as .FBX files.<br>
4.Use Blender to combine the animated models into one.<br>
5.Export as .GLB (animation as Animation Group).<br>
6.Import the .GLB file into babylon.js file.<br>
7.We're going to repeat these steps and add the rest of the characters.<br>
